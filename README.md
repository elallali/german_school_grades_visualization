A bar chart to display german school grades - Säulendiagram für deutsche Schulnoten

Germany uses a 5- or 6-point grading scale (GPA) to evaluate academic performance for the youngest to the oldest students.  
Grades vary from 1 (excellent, sehr gut) to 5 (resp. 6) (insufficient, nicht genügend).  
Data in this form is an issue for data analysts which would like to visualize the data as a barchat in an invese way, because computers consider the highest value as the best.  

For example in the german school grades 1.0 should have the biggest bar and 5.0 the smallest (See Picture example.png)

This bar char was created using ggplot2 R library and is compatible with an integration with Power BI.
I create another solution for Python Analysts.
